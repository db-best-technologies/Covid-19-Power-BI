Result:         Union of all the data that is unpivoted for the measures in the report
Format:
    Attribute:                  Contains values of Confirmed,Deaths,Recovered,Active
    "Cumulative Value":         Uses the reported cumulative value for Confirmed,Deaths,Recovered,Active Note: Active values of 0 not computed correctly
    "Change Since Prior Day"    Uses difference of the prior day's Cumulative Value with today's Cumulative Value
    "Period Ending Date UTC":   Uses date from files as a period ending 11:59:00 PM GMT
    "FIPS county code":         Uses FIPS. Full list can be found at https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/nrcs/detail/national/home/?cid=nrcs143_013697. 
    "City or County":           Uses Admin2. County name doesn't directly match FIPS country code
    "Province or State":        Uses Province_State
    "Country or Region":        Uses Country_Region
    "Last Updated UTC":         Uses Last_Update. This doesn't always align to the file date due to updates/
    Latitude:                   Uses Latitude or Lat columns.
    Longitude:                  Uses Longitude or Long_ columns.

- step: $id01
    ParseHTML:  https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_daily_reports
    Reason:     Daily updates are made to the files
    Challenge: 
        - Zero:     Files prior to 03-10-2020 did not conclude Lat and Long columns. Also, the Last Update value time stamp has different formats. Assuming the times are UMT.
          Header:   Province/State,Country/Region,Last Update,Confirmed,Deaths,Recovered
          Example:  Hubei,Mainland China,2020-02-29T12:13:10,66337,2727,28993

        - First:    Reports up earlier than 03-10-2020 inconsistently used Province/State to report US County name, State abbreviation. The word County followed the county name.
          Header:   Province/State,Country/Region,Last Update,Confirmed,Deaths,Recovered,Latitude,Longitude
          Example:  "New York County, NY",US,2020-03-09T17:13:16,19,0,0,40.7128,-74.0060

        - Second:   Reports between 03-10-2020 and 03-21-2020 inclusive used Province/State to report just the US State name - no more county information
          Header:   Province/State,Country/Region,Last Update,Confirmed,Deaths,Recovered,Latitude,Longitude
          Example:  New York,US,2020-03-10T17:13:27,173,0,0,42.1657,-74.9481

        - Third:    Reports after 03-21-202 now include new columns. The Admin2 column when available is just the name of the county. Also, column headers for Lat,Long_ changed
          Header:   FIPS,Admin2,Province_State,Country_Region,Last_Update,Lat,Long_,Confirmed,Deaths,Recovered,Active,Combined_Key
          Example:  36061,New York City,New York,US,3/22/20 23:45,40.7672726,-73.97152637,9654,63,0,0,"New York City, New York, US"
    Meaning:    For the period of 03-10-2020 and 03-21-2020, data from CDC for counties in the US are missing.
